This project deals with the generalization of force-relevant skills for tasks with changing force fields based on learned skills. When introducing a change in a task already learned from demonstration, it could lead to task failure due to discrepancy which would require that the task be relearned to compensate for this. To avoid having to relearn the task through a human operator every time the task situation changes, a parametric model estimation approach can be used to adapt to changes in the task based on prelearned motion trajectories captured by learning from demonstration. These trajectories are encoded as dynamical movement primitives (DMP), whereafter an iterative adaptation scheme, in this case based on the translational admittance controller, would adapt to the compliant profiles parameters representing the new task situation via motion- and force errors between the current movements and the prelearned trajectories. This approach is then validated using a numerical simulation and a real-life experiment with the UR5 robotic manipulator for the task of closing a drawer.
